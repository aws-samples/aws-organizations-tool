# Organizational Unit Specification.
#
# This specification maps the Organization's structure and assigns policies and
# accounts to organizational units.
#
# Each organizational_unit spec (OU) has the following attributes:
#   Name (str):     The name of the OU (required)
#   Ensure (str):   One of 'present' (default) or 'absent'.  Setting to 
#                   'absent' will cause the OU to be deleted but
#                   only if no accounts are still assigned to the OU.
#   Accounts (list(str)): 
#                   List of account names assigned to this OU.
#   SC_Policies (list(str)): 
#                   List of Service Control Policies attached to this OU.
#   Child_OU (list(organizational_unit)):
#                   List of child Organizational Units (recursive structure).
