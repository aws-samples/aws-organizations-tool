# AWS Auth Delegations Specification
#
# A delegation is a complex of IAM resources which combine to allow
# users in the ('trusted') Auth account to access and manipulate
# resources in one or several or the other ('trusting') accounts in
# the Organization.  This is accomplished by managing a delegation
# role in the trusting accounts which contains a trust policy naming
# the Auth account as 'principal', and by assigning 'assume role'
# policies to a managed group in the Auth account for each trusting
# account within the scope of the delegation specification.
#
# Each delegation spec has the following attributes:
#   RoleName (str):     The name of the IAM role created in trusting accounts.
#   Ensure ('present'[default]|'absent'):
#                       Determines whether the IAM role exists or not.
#                       Setting to 'absent' deletes delegation roles in
#                       trusting accounts and removes assume role policies
#                       from the trusted group.
#   Description (str):  A decription applied to the IAM role.
#   Path (str):         Path prefix for the IAM user resource name. (optional)
#                       If Path is not fully qualified (i.e. starts with '/'),
#                       awsauth prepends the 'default_path' to Path.
#   TrustingAccount (list(str), 'ALL'):
#                       List of trusting accounts within the scope of the
#                       delegation.  If set to 'ALL', all accounts in the
#                       Organization are include in the delegation.
#   ExcludeAccounts (list(str)):
#                       If 'TrustingAccount' attribute is set to 'ALL',
#                       any accounts listed in 'ExludeAccounts' are
#                       excluded from the delegation.
#   TrustedGroup (str): The IAM group in the Auth account in which to assign
#                       assume role policies for this delegation.
#   TrustedAccount (str):
#                       The account Id to use as principle in service roles.
#   RequireMFA (bool):  When set to 'True' (the default), add
#                       a condition to the trust policy requiring users
#                       assuming the delegation role to have valid MFA token.
#   Duration (int):     MaxSessionDuration time in seconds. Default is 3600.
#   Policies (list(str)):
#                       List of IAM policies to attach to the delegation role
#                       in the trusting accounts.
#   PolicySet (str):    Name of the policy set to attach to the delegation role
#                       Incomplatible with "Policies".
