# Service Control Policy Specification
#
# Defines custom Service Control Policies which can then be attached 
# to Organizational Units.
#
# Each service control policy spec (SCP) has the following attributes:
#   Name (str):         The name of the SCP.
#   Ensure (str):       One of 'present' (default) or 'absent'. Setting
#                       to 'absent' will cause the SCP to be deleted, but
#                       only if it is not attached to any Organizational Unit.
#   Description (str):  The policy description.
#   Statement (list(dict)):  
#                       List of IAM policy statements applied to the SCP.
