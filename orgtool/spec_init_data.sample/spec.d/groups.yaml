#
# Each group has the following attributes:
#  Name (str):      The group name.
#  Ensure (str):    One of 'present' (default) or 'absent'. Setting to
#                   'absent' will cause the group to be deleted, but

#  Members (list(str), 'ALL'):
#                   List of IAM users who are members of this group.
#                   If set to 'ALL', all managed users in the Central
#                   Auth account become members.
#  ExcludeMembers (list(str)):
#                   If 'Members' attribute is set to 'ALL', any users
#                   listed in 'ExcludeMembers' are excluded from the group.
#  Policies (list(str)):
#                   List of IAM policies to attach to this group.
