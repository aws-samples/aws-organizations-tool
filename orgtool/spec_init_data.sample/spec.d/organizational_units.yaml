# Organizational Unit Specification.
#
# This specification maps the Organization's structure and assigns policies and
# accounts to organizational units.
#
# Each organizational_unit spec (OU) has the following attributes:
#   Name (str):     The name of the OU (required)
#   Ensure (str):   One of 'present' (default) or 'absent'.  Setting to
#                   'absent' will cause the OU to be deleted but
#                   only if no accounts are still assigned to the OU.
#   Accounts (list(str)):
#                   List of account names assigned to this OU.
#   SC_Policies (list(str)):
#                   List of Service Control Policies attached to this OU.
#   Child_OU (list(organizational_unit)):
#                   List of child Organizational Units (recursive structure).
#   IncludeConfigPath (string):
#                   Path to the config file of an orgtool configuration to include here for the tree and merge for the Accounts and SCPs
#                   The Name of OU is equal to the name of the upper OU in the included configuration
#   MountingOUPath (string):
#                   For an included configuration, this is the reference to the mounting point path into the OUs tree.
#                   This exists only if the upper name of the tree is not "root". if not, raise an exception
#                   The upper name of the tree is equal to the OU name of the mounting point
#   PrefixRequired:
#                   Only used with IncludeConfigPath.
#                   Prefix value to use to validate naming convention for included SCP name
#   Tags (dict):    Tags to apply to the AWS OU. The tag value can have
#                   up to 256 characters.
#                   Valid characters: a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and . : + = @ _ / - (hyphen)
