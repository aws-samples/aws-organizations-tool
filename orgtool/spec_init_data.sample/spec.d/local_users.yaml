# do not have a login profile.

# Each local user spce has the following attributes:
#   Name (str):       The name of local IAM user.

#   ContactEmail (str):      
#                     The email address with which the user can be contacted.

#   RequestId (str):  Ticketing system tracking number of a new user request.
#

#   Account (list(str), 'ALL'):
#                     List of accounts in which the user is deployed.
#                     If set to 'ALL', the local user will be created in
#                     all accounts in the Organization.
#   ExcludeAccounts (list(str)):
#                     If 'TrustingAccount' attribute is set to 'ALL',
#                     any accounts listed in 'ExcludeAccounts' are
#                     excluded from the delegation.
