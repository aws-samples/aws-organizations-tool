Dear User,

You have been granted access to our central AWS authentication
account.  From here you can assume designated roles into other AWS
accounts in our Organization.

You must complete the following tasks to configure your access:


1) Use the credentials below to log into the AWS console.  You will be
required to change your password as you log in.  The rules for good
passwords are as follows:

- Minimum password length: 14
- Require at least one uppercase character from Latin alphabet. (A-Z)
- Require at least one lowercase character from Latin alphabet. (a-z)
- Require at least one symbol. (!@#$$%^&amp;*()_+-=[]{}|')
- Require at least one number. (0-9)

IMPORTANT: your one time password will expire after 24 hours.

  IAM User Name:	$user_name
  One Time Password:	$onetimepw
  Login URL:            https://${trusted_account}.signin.aws.amazon.com/console


2) Set up your 'Virtual MFA Device' in the AWS console.

account access.  From the delegation information listed below supply
the account_alias or account_id in the 'Account' field.  Supply the
